# Web Portfolio

This is a personal web portfolio project that showcases my projects, resume, and other information. It's built using a variety of technologies and features, including Vue.js, Django, Docker, and PostgreSQL.

Live site is available at [jakerichards.info](https://www.jakerichards.info)

## Technologies Used

### Vue.js

In this project, Vue.js is used to build the frontend of the application, creating components for the web app.

### Django

Django is used as the backend server to communicate between the Frontend and Postgres database, as well as making api calls that might include sensitive keys.

### Docker

Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring that it runs the same way in every environment from production to deployment.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is the primary database for this project. It stores data related to the projects showcased on the webapp, preventing excessive API calls to GitHub.
