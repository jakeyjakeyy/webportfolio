# Web Portfolio

This is a personal web portfolio project that showcases my projects, skills, and information. It's built using a variety of technologies and features, including Vue.js, Docker, PostgreSQL, and caching.

Live site is available at [jakerichards.info](https://www.jakerichards.info)

## Technologies Used

### Vue.js

In this project, Vue.js is used to build the frontend of the application, creating components for parts of the web app.

### Docker

Docker is used to containerize the application, ensuring that it runs the same way in every environment from production to deployment.

### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for this project. It stores data related to the projects showcased in the portfolio, preventing excessive API calls to GitHub.
